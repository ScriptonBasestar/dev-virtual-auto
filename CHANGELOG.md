# Changelog

All notable changes to DVA are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `dva doctor` command: environment prerequisite checks and setup diagnostics
- `dva migrate` command: detect legacy `.hip.yml` / old `dva.yml` format and generate migration guide
- `dva completion bash|zsh|fish`: shell autocompletion (Cobra built-in, dynamic interaction commands included)
- Command hooks system (`before`/`replace`/`after`) for hookable lifecycle commands (`up`, `down`, `stop`, `restart`, `build`, `clean`, `logs`)
- `DVA_CURRENT_UID` special variable (numeric user ID); `DVA_CURRENT_USER` now returns username (string)
- `--exclude-tags` flag on `up`/`down` to skip tagged services at runtime
- `env_file` loading now active in config pipeline

### Fixed
- `DVA_CURRENT_USER` was returning UID (number) instead of username (string)
- `env_file` field was parsed but never loaded into environment
- Tag filtering (`FilterInteractions`, `exclude_tags`) was implemented but not called for subprojects
- `os.Exit(1)` inside `RunE` replaced with `return err` for consistent cobra error handling

## [0.1.16] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `dva show` command: config summary (profiles, environments, commands)
- `--env` flag: named environment profiles (`environments:` section in dva.yml)
- `--mode` flag: operational mode profiles (`profiles:` section in dva.yml)
- `default_profile` field in `provision` config for profile fallback
- `dva provision --list`: list available provision profiles
- USAGE.md: comprehensive command and flag reference

### Changed
- `EnvFile` removed from environment profiles (simplification)
